# Modelling & Numerical Methods Coursework

This is one of my coursework from my master's course. It is a coursework on solving the Navier-stokes equation using finite difference method (FDM) and develop the code to simulate a electric appliance, where fluid within is flow as well as heated by surrounding boundary.

## Please refer to the part_one.ipynb for the code
